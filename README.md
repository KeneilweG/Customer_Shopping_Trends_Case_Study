# Customer_Shopping_Trends_Case_Study
# 📘 Description
This project explores how customers shop—what they buy, how often, and what influences their decisions. Using a dataset of **3,900** transactions from **1 January 2025 to 29 June 2025**, I built five dashboards to help uncover patterns in customer behavior and shopping trends over time.

# ❗ Problem Statement
It’s not always easy to understand customer shopping trends. We often don’t know what drives purchases, which products are preferred, or how behavior changes across time. This project solves that by analyzing customer data to reveal clear patterns and insights.

# 🎯 Aim
To turn customer shopping data into useful insights that help improve product choices, promotions, and customer experience.

# ✅ Objectives
- Show how age, gender, and location affect shopping behavior
- Highlight which products perform best and when
- Identify customers who shop often and what they prefer
- Understand how size, color, and payment method influence purchases
- Spot trends over time using the purchase date

# 📊 Dataset Summary
### The dataset includes:

- Customer details: age, gender, location, subscription status
- Purchase info: item, category, size, color, price
- Promotions: discounts, promo codes
- Reviews and shipping type
- A new column called processdate to track when purchases happened

# 🧰 Tools Used
